### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a guy looking to build stuff, obsessed with improving my craft and fascinated with the hidden technology that runs everyday life!


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about "the built environment" and architecture (buildings).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about computer systems, UNIX, email (IMAP, SMTP, Exchange, Office 365)
  and [Geographic Information Systems (GIS)](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) -- specifically: [this](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-indoors/overview), [this](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-enterprise/overview) and [this](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-utility-network/overview).
- ðŸ¤¨ [This](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-geoevent-server) often distracts me and makes my head hurt.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I speak (reasonable) IMAP and SMTP. And I'm an aspiring private GA pilot.
- I built the BLE iBeacon toolbox: a set of python and bash scripts to make manage, debug and optimize any iBeacon deployment easier and through an empirical and CI/CD approach.
