### Hi there 👋

I'm just a guy looking to build stuff, obsessed with improving my craft and fascinated with the hidden technology that runs everyday life!


- 🌱 I’m currently learning about "the built environment" and 🏢 architecture (buildings).
- 💬 Ask me about computer systems, UNIX, email (IMAP, SMTP, Exchange, Office 365)  
and 🌎 [Geographic Information Systems (GIS)](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) -- mainly [this](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-indoors/overview) and [this](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-enterprise/overview); sometimes [this](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-utility-network/overview).
- 🤨 [This](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-geoevent-server) often distracts me but makes my head hurt.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I speak (reasonable) IMAP [(v4rev1)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3501/) and [SMTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321).  
✈️ And I'm an aspiring private GA pilot.
- 👨🏼‍💻 I built the BLE iBeacon toolbox: a set of python and bash scripts to make manage, debug and optimize any iBeacon deployment easier and through an empirical and CI/CD approach.
